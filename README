Application for monitoring LVM volumes and moving blocks based on usage to 
higher or lower tier storage.

ATM quite rudimentary, more of a helper script.

to compile:
gcc -std=gnu99 -Wall lvmtsd.c -o lvmtsd

lvmtsd is used like this:
btrace -t -a complete /dev/vol-grp00/log-vol00 | awk ' {print $7, $8/(2*4*1024), ($8+$10)/(2*4*1024)} ' | ./lvmtsd

It will dump collected data (including 200 most active, most written and most
read blocks in format ready to use with pvmove) when the pipe is broken (killall
blktrace).


To compile lvmls:
gcc -llvm2cmd lvmls.c -o lvmls -std=gnu99 -Wall

lvmls is test code for parsing pvs output, extracting PV extent to LV extent 
allocations.
